|     |   Write at least 10 SQL queries for a suitable       | Open 3  |
|     |   database application using SQL DML statements      |        |

| 4   | Unnamed PL/SQL code block: Use of Control structure  |        |
|     |   and Exception handling is mandatory. Write a PL/SQL | Open 4  |
|     |   block of code for the following requirements:       |        |
|     |   Schema:                                            |        |
|     |   1. Borrower (Roll, Name, DateofIssue, NameofBook,   |        |
|     |      Status)                                         |        |
|     |   2. Fine (Roll, Date, Amt)                          |        |
|     |   Accept Roll & Name of book from the user. Check the |        |
|     |   number of days (from the date of issue), if days   |        |
|     |   are between 15 to 30 then fine amount will be Rs 5 |        |
|     |   per day. If the number of days > 30, per day fine  |        |
|     |   will be Rs 50 per day, and for days less than 30,  |        |
|     |   Rs. 5 per day. After submitting the book, status   |        |
|     |   will change from I to R. If the condition of fine  |        |
|     |   is true, then details will be stored into the Fine |        |
|     |   table. Frame the problem statement for writing     |        |
|     |   PL/SQL block in line with the above statement.     |        |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| 5   | Named PL/SQL Block: PL/SQL Stored Procedure and       |        |
|     |   Stored Function. Write a Stored Procedure namely   | Open 5  |
|     |   proc_Grade for the categorization of students. If |        |
|     |   marks scored by students in the examination is <=  |        |
|     |   1500 and marks >= 990, then the student will be    |        |
|     |   placed in the distinction category. If marks are  |        |
|     |   between 989 and 900, the category is the first     |        |
|     |   class. If marks 899 and 825, the category is Higher |        |
|     |   Second Class. Write a PL/SQL block to use the      |        |
|     |   procedure created with the above requirement.      |        |
|     |   Stud_Marks(name, total_marks)                      |        |
|     |   Result(Roll, Name, Class)                          |        |
|     | ---                                                | ---    |
| 6   | Cursors: (All types: Implicit, Explicit, Cursor    |        |
|     |   FOR Loop, Parameterized Cursor) Write a PL/SQL    | Open 6  |
|     |   block of code using a parameterized Cursor that    |        |
|     |   will merge the data available in the newly         |        |
|     |   created table N_EmpId with the data available in   |        |
|     |   the table O_EmpId. If the data in the first table   |        |
|     |   already exists in the second table, then that     |        |
|     |   data should be skipped.                            |        |

| 7   | Database Trigger (All Types: Row level and         |        |
|     |   Statement level triggers, Before and After         | Open 7  |
|     |   Triggers). Write a database trigger on the Library |        |
|     |   table. The system should keep track of the records |        |
|     |   that are being updated or deleted. The old value   |        |
|     |   of updated or deleted records should be added in  |        |
|     |   the Library_Audit table. Frame the problem         |        |
|     |   statement for writing Database Triggers of all     |        |
|     |   types, in line with the above statement. The       |        |
|     |   problem statement should clearly state the        |        |
|     |   requirements.                                      |        |

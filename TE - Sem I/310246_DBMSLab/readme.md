| 1   | ER Modeling and Normalization                        | Open 1  |
| 2   | SQL Queries<br> a. Design and Develop SQL DDL statements which demonstrate the use of SQL objects such as Table, View, Index, Sequence, Synonym, different constraints etc. | Open 2  |
| 3   | SQL Queries all types of Join, Sub-Query and View: Write at least 10 SQL queries for a suitable database application using SQL DML statements | Open 3  |
| 4   | Unnamed PL/SQL code block: Use of Control structure and Exception handling is mandatory. Write a PL/SQL block of code for the following requirements: <br>Schema: 1. Borrower (Roll, Name, DateofIssue, NameofBook, Status) <br>2. Fine (Roll, Date, Amt) <br> Accept Roll & Name of book from the user. Check the number of days (from the date of issue), if days are between 15 to 30 then fine amount will be Rs 5 per day. If the number of days > 30, per day fine will be Rs 50 per day, and for days less than 30, Rs. 5 per day. After submitting the book, status will change from I to R. If the condition of fine is true, then details will be stored into the Fine table. Frame the problem statement for writing PL/SQL block in line with the above statement. | Open 4  |
| 5   | Named PL/SQL Block: PL/SQL Stored Procedure and Stored Function. <br> Write a Stored Procedure namely proc_Grade for the categorization of students. If marks scored by students in the examination is <= 1500 and marks >= 990, then the student will be placed in the distinction category. If marks are between 989 and 900, the category is the first class. If marks 899 and 825, the category is Higher Second Class. <br> Write a PL/SQL block to use the procedure created with the above requirement. Stud_Marks(name, total_marks) Result(Roll, Name, Class) | Open 5  |
| 6   | Cursors: (All types: Implicit, Explicit, Cursor FOR Loop, Parameterized Cursor) <br> Write a PL/SQL block of code using a parameterized Cursor that will merge the data available in the newly created table N_EmpId with the data available in the table O_EmpId. If the data in the first table already exists in the second table, then that data should be skipped. | Open 6  |
| 7   | Database Trigger (All Types: Row level and Statement level triggers, Before and After Triggers). <br> Write a database trigger on the Library table. The system should keep track of the records that are being updated or deleted. The old value of updated or deleted records should be added in the Library_Audit table. Frame the problem statement for writing Database Triggers of all types, in line with the above statement. The problem statement should clearly state the requirements. | Open 7  |
| 8   | Database Connectivity: <br> Write a program to implement MySQL/Oracle database connectivity with any front end language to implement Database navigation operations (add, delete, edit, etc.) | Open 8  |
| 9   | Design and Develop MongoDB Queries using CRUD operations. (Use CRUD operations, SAVE method, logical operators) | Open 9  |
| 10  | MongoDB Aggregation and Indexing: <br> Design and Develop MongoDB Queries using aggregation and indexing with a suitable example using MongoDB | Open 10 |
| 11  | MongoDB Map-reduces operations: <br> Implement Map reduces operation with a suitable example using MongoDB. | Open 11 |
| 12  | Database Connectivity: <br> Write a program to implement MongoDB database connectivity with any front end language to implement Database navigation operations (add, delete, edit, etc.) | Open 12 |

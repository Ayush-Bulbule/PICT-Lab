# Deep Learning 

Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. It is a powerful tool for various applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.


## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup
### Python 
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. It is widely used in data science, machine learning, web development, and automation.

### Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.

### Google Colab
Google Colab is a free cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that allows you to write and execute Python code in your browser. It is particularly popular for machine learning and deep learning tasks due to its integration with Google Drive and support for GPU acceleration.
